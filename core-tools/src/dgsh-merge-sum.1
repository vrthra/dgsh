.SH NAME
dgsh-merge-sum \- merge key value pairs, summing the values
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdgsh-merge-sum\fP \fIfile ...\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIdgsh-merge-sum\fP will read \fIkey\fP, \fIvalue\fP pairs from the files
specified in its standard input,
and print the input records merged together according to the value of the key.
The input files should be sorted according to the key's value.
Records with the same key will have their values summed, and a single
corresponding record will be printed.
Whitespace is used as the separator.
Leading whitespace is not taken into account when parsing fields.
Thus \fIdgsh-merge-sum\fP can process multiple files
generated by \fIuniq -c\fP,
and merge them into one.
