## Installation of unix tools adapted for dgsh

While under the dgsh root directory, type the following sequence of commands:

```bash
make libdgsh.a # compile the dgsh negotiation library
cd unix-tools
make get-submodules   # download repos of Unix tools if not already cloned
                      # with the superproject through --recursive
make configure        # configure tools
make make             # compile
make install          # install in ./bin
make -s test          # run tests
```

The current collection of Unix tools include *coreutils, gawk, grep, parallel, sed, and tar*.
Of those currently *comm*, *join*, *paste*, and *sort* have been adapted for use with dgsh.

## Adaptation workflow

Head to the tool's repo, e.g., unix-tools/coreutils and locate its source code, e.g., src/comm.c

The workflow includes the following steps:

- adapt the tool for use with dgsh
  - invoke the dgsh negotiation API similarly to the code that follows
  - use the provided file descriptors in place of the tool's original input and output interface. You can take a look at the already adapted tools source.

```C
#include <stdio.h>		/* printf() */
#include <stdlib.h>		/* exit() */
#include "dgsh.h"

int
main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	if (dgsh_negotiate("secho", NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL) != 0)
		exit(1);

	++argv;
	while (*argv) {
		(void)printf("%s", *argv);
		if (*++argv)
			putchar(' ');
	}
	putchar('\n');

	return 0;
}
```

- contribute tests
  - *cd simple_shell*
  - express a graph of dgsh adapted processes with interconnected inputs and outputs, such as the example that follows. The example has the secho and paste tools connect the former's output to the latter's input. Because they are both dgsh-compatible they use a socketpipe to carry out the dgsh negotiation phase. You can find this file as *secho_paste.dgsh*.
  - run the test with *python simple_shell.py secho_paste.dgsh secho_paste.out* to produce and store the output in file *secho_paste.out*.

```bash
1 /home/mfg/dds/dgsh/unix-tools/bin/secho hello
2 /home/mfg/dds/dgsh/unix-tools/bin/paste - world

%
socketpipe 1 2
```

- add tests to Makefile's *make test* recipe

```Makefile
PSEUDOSHELLDIR=../simple-shell

test:
    cd $PSEUDOSHELLDIR && \
    python simple-shell.py secho_paste.dgsh secho_paste.out && \
    diff secho_paste.out secho_paste.success && \
    echo "Test secho | paste successful." || \
    echo "Test secho | paste failed."
```

- run tests
```bash
make -s test
```
